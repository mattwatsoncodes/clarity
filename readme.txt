== Description ==

Give your users an idea of what a page template looks like before they choose it. 

Created by [Make Do](http://makedo.in/), this plugin that takes over the 'add new' page screen, and displays a visual picker to let you choose the page hierarchy and the page template.

For usage instructions check out the screenshots.

If you are using this plugin in your project [we would love to hear about it](mailto:hello@makedo.in).

== Installation ==

1. Backup your WordPress install
2. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The standard list of pages here, we have a couple of levels of hierarchy already setup. Lets click the 'Add New' button.
2. A window pops up and gives us a visual representation of the page hierarchy. We can digg down and choose a parent page for our new page from here.
3. Clicking the folders will expand them and show the pages under them.
4. Choosing a folder will highlight it. Lets stick with this choice and hit next.
5. We can choose from a visual representation of templates (you can set all these up in the options for the plugin). 
6. Lets choose the middle one, it will highlight it for us. Now lets continue.
7. You can see that the template we chose and the parent have been selected for us under the 'Page Attributes' metabox.
8. The options page for clarity, lets you upload representations for each template.
